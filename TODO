this seems like a curses job really
probably unsolvable with plain sh/bash
terminfo provides restrains on scroll regions
    If  the  terminal has a settable scrolling region (like the vt100) the command to set this can be described with the csr capability, which
    takes two parameters: the top and bottom lines of the scrolling region.  The cursor position is, alas, undefined after using this command.
    It is possible to get the effect of insert or delete line using csr on a properly chosen region; the sc and rc (save and  restore  cursor)
    commands  may  be  useful  for  ensuring  that your synthesized insert/delete string does not move the cursor.  (Note that the ncurses(3X)
    library does this synthesis automatically, so you need not compose insert/delete strings for an entry with csr).
